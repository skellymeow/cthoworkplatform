## ⚠️ Framer Motion & Next.js: Export * Error

If you see this error:

```
Error: It's currently unsupported to use "export *" in a client boundary. Please use named exports instead.
```

This means you are importing `framer-motion` in a file that is used by a Next.js server component or shared between server and client. **Framer Motion must only be imported in client components.**

### How to Fix
- Only use `import { motion } from 'framer-motion'` in files that start with `'use client'` at the top.
- Never import framer-motion in server components, shared files, or files that are imported by server components.
- If you need animation in a page or component, add `'use client'` at the top of the file.

**This is a Next.js/React limitation.**
