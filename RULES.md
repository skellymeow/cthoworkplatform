# RULES - FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY

## DESIGN SYSTEM
- **Colors**: ONLY black, white, grey - NO accent colors
- **Background**: `bg-black`
- **Text**: `text-white/90`, `text-white/70`, `text-white/50`, `text-white/30`
- **Borders**: `border-white/10` or `border-white/20`

- **Typography**: Use `TYPOGRAPHY.h3`, `TEXT_COLORS.primary`, `SPACING.md`
- **NO GREEN/RED/BLUE/ORANGE** - EVER

## CODING RULES
1. **READ VERBATIM** - Do exactly what user asks, nothing more
2. **ONE CHANGE AT A TIME** - If user asks for 1 edit, make 1 edit only
3. **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - Don't assume, don't add features, don't "improve"
4. **PLAN FIRST** - Use the planning feature before coding
5. **SIMPLE SOLUTIONS** - If it can be 1 line, make it 1 line

2. **CONFIRM** - Ask if unsure, don't assume
3. **APOLOGIZE** - When you mess up, admit it
